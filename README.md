# PHP Array Sum Function with Null Value Handling

This repository contains a PHP function designed to sum integers within an array.  However, the original function has a bug: it prematurely returns 0 if any null value is encountered. This improved version provides a robust solution that handles null values correctly, ensuring accurate summation only of valid integer elements.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction` function attempts to calculate the sum of integers in an array.  It's flawed because it doesn't handle `null` values effectively, causing it to return 0 prematurely, even if there are valid integers present.  The solution addresses this issue, ensuring proper handling of null values and type checking for integers.

## Solution

The solution implements improved error handling and data type validation. It iterates through the array, skipping null values and ensuring that only integers contribute to the sum, resulting in accurate and reliable summation.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Execute the `bugSolution.php` file.
3. Observe the correct output of the sum, which excludes null values.
